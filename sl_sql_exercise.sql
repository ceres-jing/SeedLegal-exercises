reference of some usages in this function:

with ordinality: 
                When a function in the FROM clause is suffixed by WITH ORDINALITY, 
                a bigint column is appended to the output which starts from 1 and increments by 1 for the function's output. 
                This is most useful in the case of set returning functions such as unnest().

array_agg:      input values, including nulls, concatenated into an array
::text   :      cast to a text type

/* 

Reflection of these two SQL functions:

Figure out how these two functions work is more challenging than the python class. 
Because Some functions/usages within the created function  are not familiar to me,
but also because there is no concrete example/table for me to work through.

I approached this question by first figuring out those unfamiliar usages while also imagining a table and an array 
to see how it is transformed through these operations.  As you can see above, I have listed some usages within the created function 
that I need to check online. I think the most tricky one is â€œunnest".  After thinking and going through the code back and forth,
I realized the data might be stored as JSON format.  eg. 'column':[1,2,3,4,5]. then it makes sense to unnest it from array to rows.

With an example in my mind, I then went through the function from beginning to end.  I realized it was about finding the 
median value.  After that, I created a table and inserted the values.  Run two functions to verify my finding. It tunred out 
to be right.

Finally, I read through the code to make it more structured and added comments and one usage case.
